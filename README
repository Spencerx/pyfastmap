TODO:
  - Implemented StringMap on top of FastMap (http://flamingo.ics.uci.edu/pub/dasfaa03.pdf)



FastMap
-------

FastMap is a fast algorithm for indexing, data-mining, and visualization of traditional and multimedia datasets. It maps objects into points in some k-dimensional space (k is user-defined) such that the dis-similarities are preserved.

Two benefits from this mapping:
    - efficient retrieval
    - visualization and data-mining

The objects can now be plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing potential clusters, correlations among attributes and other regularities that data-mining typically looks for.


StringMap
